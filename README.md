#Project Title
#•	Study of Twitter Sentiment Analysis and possible correlation to changes in the Stock Market.
#Problem Addressed
#•	Utilizing the AFIN-111 method, I intend to perform twitter sentiment analysis on a corporations mention on Twitter. This will then be correlated against the rise/fall/stagnation of the selected companies for analysis stock prices. This will allow for the ability to determine if a company’s stock price will be changed based off of the information garnered from Twitter.
#Presentation Method
#•	This information will be displayed via web page as the process allows for discovery live via data inputted into the system.
#Analysis Mechanism
#•	There will be two distinct types of data sets used for this project. One gathered live which will be the Twitter Sentiment. Also, a data set that is publicly available from Quandl. The positive/negative analysis of the Twitter sentiment will be used to determine the bias of a corporation over a period of time. That will then be compared to the changes of the corporation’s stock information. This can then be utilized to possibly build a model that will allow for the prediction of stock changes based on Twitter sentiment.
#Data Description
#•	It will be a collection of Twitter sentiment and table data retrieved from Quandl. The twitter sentiment will be text based and graded based on AFIN-111 while the Quandl data will be numerical and be utilized to detect changes based on percentages up or down.
#Project Issues
#•	The amounts of data consumed lead to sever processing issues and therefore had to be modified for better processing.
#•	Correlation proved difficult due to the human element
#•	Language barriers with AFIN-111 and understanding true positive versus negative statements
